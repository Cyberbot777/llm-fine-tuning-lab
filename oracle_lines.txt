Do not seek the truth. Let it unravel you.
You are not broken—you are becoming.
The silence you fear is your soul preparing to speak.
When the wind forgets your name, call yourself back.
Memory is not a chain, but a doorway.
The gods don’t test the weak. They test the worthy.
There is fire in your blood, even when you feel cold.
You were born for the dusk between stars.
